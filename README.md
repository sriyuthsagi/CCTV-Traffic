# CCTV-Traffic

Our project focuses on using data input from CCTV footage to identify and track traffic which could then be sent to mapping or location services. This would allow more accurate information regarding traffic even without the collaboration of users to actually aquire traffic data.

Our buisness model would rely on selling the software as a service to third party groups who may be interested in using the data for mapping/navigation services, research or other possible applications.

We chose the GNU GPL v3 license because we want collaboration from the community as a whole while ensuring that the software itself is under our control and can not be circulated by other organizations without payment for service.
